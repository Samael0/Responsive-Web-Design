            Start off at the Rope Bridge Cave bonfire in The Painted World of Ariandel area. 
            From the bonfire head across the rope bridge. The enemies here will 
            not attack you, but you can slaughter them if you wish.
            </p>
    
            <p>
            <code>Just ahead</code> there’s an NPC (who you will fight later on). 
            Before you talk to the NPC, circle around to the right to 
            find a corpse holding a Hollow Gem.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                Speak to the NPC, then head through the double doors behind him. Light the Ariandel 
                Chapel bonfire and speak with Lady Friede in the corner.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can head up the nearby ladder, but there’s nothing in the room above just yet. 
                There will be an NPC there later so remember this location.

            Kill the lizard to obtain a Twinkling Titanite, but be very careful here. In addition to the knights on the ledge near the 
                    lizard, there are two more large knights with greatbows nearby.
            </p>
    
            <p>
            One is very near the ground level, and the other is perched on a branch above you. Stay on the move to avoid 
                    the various projectile attacks while you move around this area.
            </p>
            <p>
            Defeat the first lesser knight, the head across the next branch to find an item corpse on the far side that holds an Ember. Turn around and head to the immediate 
                    right, hugging the cliff side as you inch along the narrow path.

                Go down the ladder, into the dark passage and grab the 
                Soul of a Deserted Corpse. Enter the tower underneath the dragon and grab the Deep Battle Axe, provided you took out the Mimic guarding it.

                If they raise their lanterns and chant, the Hollows 
                nearby will head in your direction. They're not difficult, especially if you sidestep their stabs and downward strikes, which they use frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, as we mentioned in our beginner's guide, it's best not to fight more than one at a time

                From the bonfire, take the stairs on the left. Grab
                the Soul of a Deserted Corpse on the left side of the wall. Taking the stairs to the tower interior (past the dragon head) 
                will keep you on the critical path.

                When you're done here, don't go down the stairs you came

            YFrom here, you can drop down to the tower interior. Take out the two Hollow Soldiers on this level, including one hiding behind some boxes.

                You can take on the dragon with bow and arrows, 
                if you have them. If you hug the left side of the stairs leading up to the dragon, you can aim for its more vulnerable wing rather than its body.

            Whenever you decide to take on the dragon, 
            defeating it will give you access to the upper area, which features an Ember, a Club, a Claymore and a Steel Soldier Helm.
            
            <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
    
            
            <p>
                Run across the bottom portion of the wall 
                segment to continue along the critical path. If the dragon is still alive, time your runs for when it isn't breathing fire.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ascend the stairs and take on a Lothric Knight. This is a great training enemy to prepare you for all the harder knights you'll come across.
